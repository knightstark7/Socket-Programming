# Socket_Project
Project Socket in Computer Network Subject - HCMUS

The goal is to write a simple web server. Webserver will bind on port 8080. You can use any web browser as client (Firefox, Chrome, Safari, ...) to send request to web server and webserver will send response back to client (content of page, or error). The content of the web page is pre-programmed, the web server will read the file content and return it to the client (src_html_de01 folder)
